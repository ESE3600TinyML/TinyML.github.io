F1TENTH - build documentation
================================================

Welcome to the official build documentation of `F1TENTH <http://f1tenth.org/>`_. 

If you want to learn how to make the vehicle, :ref:`Getting Started <doc_build_intro>` walks through how to build the car from ground up and get things running.

.. note:: 
  For this stable branch, only the :ref:`Build <doc_build_intro>` section is complete and up to date. We are currently working on updating the software documentation.

If you already have a working car and the work environment set up, then check out :ref:`Going Forward <doc_going_forward_intro>` to learn how to install the simulator and implement some fun algorithms.

If you don't want to build a physical car and just want to play around in the simulator, head straight to :ref:`Simulation <doc_going_forward_simulation>`.

.. note:: F1TENTH is an open source project developed by a community of
          researchers and students. The documentation team can always use your
          feedback and help to improve the tutorials and class reference. If
          you don't understand something, or cannot find what you
          are looking for in the docs, help us make the documentation better
          by letting us know!

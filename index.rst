F1TENTH - Build Documentation
================================================

Welcome to the official build documentation of `F1TENTH <http://f1tenth.org/>`_. 

This is the most up to date documentation. If you are looking for the old page, you can find it `here <https://f1tenth.github.io/build-old.html>`_. Please note that we no longer provide support for the old build page. If you have questions, please post to the `forum <http://f1tenth.org/forum.html>`_.

If you are new to F1TENTH, :ref:`Getting Started <doc_build_intro>` is a good place to start.

.. If you already have a working car and the work environment set up, then check out :ref:`Going Forward <doc_going_forward_intro>` to learn how to install the simulator and implement some fun algorithms.

.. If you don't want to build a physical car and just want to play around in the simulator, head straight to :ref:`Simulation <doc_going_forward_simulation>`.

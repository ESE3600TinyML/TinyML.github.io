F1TENTH Simulator
================================================

.. warning:: The following section is the documentation of the **DEPRECATED** simulation in ROS 1. We utilize a new simulation in ROS 2 at `this link <https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros>`_. This documentation page will soon be updated for that simulation.

This page goes over how to install the F1TENTH simulator. This simulator is for single car, has ROS in the loop, and does not have camera integration. If you are looking for a simulator that has multi agent capabilities and uses the OpenAI gym environment, you can find that `here <https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym>`_.

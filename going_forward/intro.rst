Introduction
==================

.. note:: This section assumes you either have gone through the entire :ref:`Getting Started <doc_build_intro>` section OR have Ubuntu Xenial 16.04/ROS Kinetic or Bionic 18.04/ROS Melodic running on a laptop.

Now that you've built the car, a whole world of possibilities begin. Or maybe, you don't want to build the physical car and just want to play in simulation. Here are a few additional add ons that would make things a lot more interesting and fun. This section will go over how get a simulator working on the host laptop and run some algorithms in it.

#. :ref:`Recording Data on the Car <doc_drive_rosbag>`

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced

.. **Approximate Time Investment:** 5-10 hours

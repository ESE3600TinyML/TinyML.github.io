Introduction
==================

Here is where you will all the information needed to get started and join the F1TENTH! This build documentation is divided into three main sections:

#. :ref:`Building the Car <doc_build_car>` - Start here if you are building the car from scratch. This part details everything from the materials needed to how to put all the hardware together.
#. :ref:`System Configuration <doc_software_setup>`- Start here if you already have a completely built car and now need to set up the software on the host laptop and the vehicle. This part goes through the how to install the required software on a host laptop and the Jetson.

..

	#. :ref:`Installing Firmware <doc_build_car_firmware>` - Start here if you've already done 1 and 2 above and are now ready to setup a working environment. This part covers VESC tuning, lidar connection, working directory setup, and rosbag recording.

.. note:: 
  If you have any build and/or setup questions, post to the `forum <http://f1tenth.org/forum.html>`_.

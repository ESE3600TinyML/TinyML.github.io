#. :ref:`System Configuration <doc_software_setup>`- Start here if you already have a completely built car and now need to set up the software on the host laptop and the vehicle. This part goes through the how to install the required software on a host laptop and the Jetson.

#. :ref:`Driving the Car <doc_drive>` - Start here if you have everything set up from the previous three sections and are ready to learn how to set up a workspace on the vehicle and start driving!

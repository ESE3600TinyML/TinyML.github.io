Autonomy Elements
==================

Removing the TX2 and Antenna
-------------------------------
**KIM: need to add notes on how to remove TX2 and antenna**

Attaching the Orbitty to the TX2
-----------------------------------
Place the Orbitty Carrier board on top of the TX2 like so:

Put an M3 x 20mm screw through one of the orbitty mount holes followed by one 8mm nylon spacer then 35mm FF M3 standoffs.  Repeat for the remaining three mounting holes.

The results should look like this:

Make sure to also plug the TX2 into the orbitty.

We can now move on to mounting all of the autonomy elements onto the upper level chassis in the next section.

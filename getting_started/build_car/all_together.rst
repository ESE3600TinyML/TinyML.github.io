Putting it all together
========================

Now that we have the autonomy elements attached to the upper level chassis, we are going to attach the upper level chassis to the lower level chassis. This part may be a tad unwieldy due to the amount of wires and cables that have to be contained.

Mounting the Upper Level Chassis to the Lower Level Chassis
------------------------------------------------------------
Gently place the upper level chassis on top of the standoffs of the lower level chassis. The VESC should be towards the back of the car. Thread the ppm cable from the lower level chassis, through one of the acrylic slot, and plug it into the ppm slot on the VESC.

Use three M3 screws to attach the acrylic to the standoffs on the lower level chassis.

Connecting the Brushless Motor to the VESC
-------------------------------------------

Voila!

Finally, screw on the antenna and your final vehicle should look like the following:
